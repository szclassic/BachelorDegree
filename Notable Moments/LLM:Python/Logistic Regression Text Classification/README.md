## Text Classification Using Logistic Regression

I utilized the Logistic Regression based text classification implemented on : https://www.kaggle.com/davidoluwatobipeter/sentiment-analysis-logistic-regression-and-lstm 

Using the model above, I gained a better understanding of classical traditional machine learning algorithm, and a deep learning algorithm that can predict the sentiment category or class of texts based on COVID-19 related tweets.

I showcased and inputted my comments for each block of code in the .ipynb file.
