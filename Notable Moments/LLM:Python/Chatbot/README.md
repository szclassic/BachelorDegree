## Eliza Chatbot

Adding upon and annotating the already-existing chatbot, ELIZA,  that is implemented using NLTK: https://www.nltk.org/_modules/nltk/chat/eliza.html

In this application, I did the following:

- Added detailed and meaningful comments that explains my understanding of the codebase for every code and response block.
- Used word normalizations in order to make the chatbot less brittle.
- Utilized one of the stemmers in NLTK to accept word variations in the user's response, and print to the chatlog the original and the stemmed versions of the user input.
- Curated new response pairs that provide emotional support for college students by being a good listener.
- Implemented a simple word tokenizer, using regular expression, that splits the stemmed version of the user's input into tokens usings "space(s)" as token boundaries.
- Wrote a summary of the functionality and my understanding of how the ELIZA program works.
