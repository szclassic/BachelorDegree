## LLM

I worked with various of datasets, mostly found on Kaggle, in order to better develop my skills working with LLMs.

Here are some of my personal projects that I completed using Python in order to:

- Introduce myself to the fundamental concepts and techniques of Natural Language Processings.
- Getting an in-depth understanding of the computational properties of natural language and the commonly used algorithms for processing language data.
- Illustrate the pervasiveness of natural language technologies in current times through real-world applications.
- Gain practical experience through hands-on exercises.


By the end of these projects, I gained:

- Thorough understanding of NLP fundamentals.
- Good graps of the internals of a modern NLP system.
- Broad understanding of the applications of NLP.
- The skillset to develop or extend complex NLP systems.
